Babel:
Convert ES6 to JS.
ES6 modules can be maintained by webpack. We have to bundle these modules by using module loader. This is the use of webpack.
Loader in webpack allows us to load different files. alos convert scss to css or convert ES6 to ES5. So babel is used for this.
MVC - Main advantage of MVC architecture is that it it very nicely decouples presentation logic from application logic, with a controller in between them that controls the entire app.

ES6 modules:
Default exports:When we want to import one thing from module.
To export multiple things we have to use named exports.

State:Stae of app in any given moment is all the data in current moment and we want it to be in a centeral object. EX in redux etc.
