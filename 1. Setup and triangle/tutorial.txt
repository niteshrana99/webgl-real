Webgl uses <canvas> to draw. So first we define this context.
Webgl stands for Web graphics library.

Vertex shader:Give each vertex a position, and any other information you want to attach as well. The role of vertex shader is basically to take the 3d points we gave it and put it in a 3d space. 

We have a co-ordinate system that goes from 1 to -1 from top to bottom as well as left to right. We can also give addition information to vertex example color.

Rasterisation:Fill in the triangles or lines or whatever. 

Fragment shader: Give each pixel a color, from the information provided from the rasterizer and uniforms.
